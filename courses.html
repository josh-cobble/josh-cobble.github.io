        <h2>Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>In this course, I was taught Java. Through multiple assignments and projects, I was able to master the language.
        I created a unit conversion program, random number generator, a "Guess the Number" game, and more. Elements of Java
        that I learned about include: arrays, arraylists, loops (for, while, do-while), hashmaps, treemaps, packages, interfaces,
        polymorphism, abstract classes, and more.</p>
    
        <h2>Introduction to C Programming and Unix</h2>
        <p>In this course, I learned C, and was taught about general programming basics. I was taught about different types of
        hardware and software. In this course, I used control statements (if, switch), variables, operators, strings, bits, bytes,
        and more basics.</p>
    
        <h2>Discrete Mathematics</h2>
        <p>In this course, I learned about abstract mathematics. I learned how think about mathematics like a computer does
        (with algorithms, variables, and patterns). I learned about sets, elements, subsets, unions, intersections, complements,
        relations, cartesian products, functions, truth tables, induction, pigeonhole principle, and more.</p>

        <h2>Calculus 2</h2>
        <p>In this course, I learned to think about mathematics in a theoretical sense. I had to imagine how things that had not
        happened yet would happen (predict trends). I also learned new ways to envision objects around me (spheres as discs).
        In this course, I mainly manipulated derivates and integrals.</p>
        
        <h2>Introductory Physics</h2>
        <p>In this course, I learned about vectors, spaces, rules and laws of physics, formulas, and new ways to think about how
        physics affects all people everyday. Using logic, I could figure out what forces acted on what objects and then use this information,
        as well as infomration about angles, to calculate unknown information.</p>
        
        <h2>Composition 2</h2>
        <p>In this course, my writing skills were strengthened through a 9-page research essay. I wrote an essay comparing the differences
        between gasoline, electric, and hybrid vehicles, citing evidence and using logic to support my claims. I was told my essay was
        too technical, but being overly technical can be good in the field of computer science.</p>
