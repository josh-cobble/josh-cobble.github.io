        <h2>Image and Video Edits</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I make image and video edits using editing software. Using creativity and multiple different editing tools,
        I can create a seemingly all-new image from an exisitng one. I have created images for the purpose of satire, comedy, and more.</p>
        
        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>Since programmers develop games, having an interest in video games makes sense. I have played them for as long as I can remember,
        and have learned patience, problem solving, strategy, and accuracy from them. Games like Minecraft and Roblox have
        made me familiar with very basic programming.</p>

        <h2>AI Usage</h2>
        <p>Since AI is becoming more common in every job field, it only makes sense to have an interest in it. Using AI, I can get help
        when I am stumped with a problem or forget the right syntax to use when coding. I have used it to help myself come up with ideas
        or to take my ideas and create something new with them.</p>

        <h2>Takeaway</h2>
        <p>Using these skills, I hope to be able to develop simple arcade-style games like Pac-Man or Super Mario. I hope to be able to program
        in multiple languages and be able to easily learn new ones (by looking at similarities between others).</p>
