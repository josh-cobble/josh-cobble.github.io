        <h2>Career Focus</h2>
        <p>I am looking for an internship where I can deliver quality efficently in the field of Computer Science.</p>
        
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Oakland University (OU) | Rochester, MI  - Undergraduate, GPA: 3.71</p>
        <p>Graduation: April 2027</p>
        <p>Pre-computer science major</p>
        
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Recycling Game (Object-Oriented Programming)</h3>
        <p>With a group of 3 others, I helped create a recycling quiz game to teach people about the importance of recycling.
        The game asks questions and the user has to select the correct answer(s). The game was made using core features of the
        Java language (arrays, arraylists, loops, hashmaps, treemaps, and more) and by using JavaFX to implement the interface.</p>
        
        <h3>Virtual Zoo (Object-Oriented Programming)</h3>
        <p>I created a virtual zoo with the Java language using different packages to hold each animal's information.
        A user could then ask one of several pre-provided questions, and facts would be pulled from package(s).
        Class types were also used to implement this (to keep animals separate when some facts overlapped).</p>
        
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        
        <h3>Whole Foods Market | Rochester Hills, MI</h3>
        <p>As a member of an Amazon-owned grocery store, I shopped for customers, fulfillng their grocery orders.
        With speed and delicacy, I completed my assigned tasks.</p>
        
        <h3>Todd Terry Allstate Agency | Shelby Township, MI</h3>
        <p>I worked as a customer service representative, answering phone calls, transferring calls,
        and informing customers about certain insurance information.</p>
        
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Leadership, hard working, problem solving, communication, teamwork, diligence, confidence, programming (some Java and C),
        technology (Microsoft Office, MacOS, iOS, and Windows)</p>
        
        <h2>Awards</h2>
        <p>OU Talented Scholar Award</p>
        <p>OU President's List Award</p>
